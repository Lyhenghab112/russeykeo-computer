# QR Persistent Payment System Guide

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
Customers can now **cancel QR payment** and **pay later** using the **same QR code**. The QR doesn't become invalid when they cancel - it stays valid for later payment.

## 🚀 **How It Works Now**

### **Before (Problem):**
1. Customer selects QR payment → QR generated
2. Customer cancels → **QR becomes invalid**
3. Customer can't pay later with same QR

### **After (Solution):**
1. Customer selects QR payment → QR generated
2. Customer cancels → **Order stays PENDING, QR stays valid**
3. Customer can pay later using **same QR code**
4. Payment status changes from PENDING to COMPLETED

## 📱 **New Customer Experience**

### **1. Initial QR Payment:**
- Customer adds items to cart
- Selects "KHQR Payment"
- QR code is generated
- Customer can scan and pay immediately

### **2. If Customer Cancels:**
- Customer clicks "Cancel" on payment modal
- **Order stays PENDING** (not cancelled)
- **QR code remains valid**
- Items are restored to cart
- Message: *"Payment cancelled. You can pay later using the same QR code."*

### **3. Pay Later:**
- Customer goes to "My Orders" page
- Sees "Pending Payments" tab
- Finds their pending order
- Clicks "Complete Payment" or "Show QR Code"
- Uses same QR to complete payment

## 🔧 **Technical Changes Made**

### **1. Modified Cancellation Behavior (`app.py`):**
```python
# OLD: Order marked as CANCELLED
Order.update_status(order_id, 'CANCELLED')

# NEW: Order stays PENDING
app.logger.info(f"Order {order_id} payment cancelled, but order remains PENDING for later payment")
```

### **2. Payment Session Persistence:**
```python
# OLD: Session marked as cancelled
PaymentSession.update_session_status(session_id, 'cancelled')

# NEW: Session stays pending
app.logger.info(f"Payment session {session_id} kept as pending for later completion")
```

### **3. Enhanced Customer Orders Page:**
- Added "Pending Payments" tab
- Shows pending orders with payment buttons
- "Complete Payment" button for pending orders
- "Show QR Code" button to display QR again

### **4. Updated Frontend Messages:**
- Cancellation message now says: *"You can pay later using the same QR code"*
- Clear indication that QR remains valid
