# Customer Soft Delete System Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The customer management system now includes **soft delete functionality** that allows you to "delete" customers while preserving all their orders and financial data. This prevents financial confusion and maintains data integrity.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔒 **Data Preservation**
- **Customer records** are never physically deleted from the database
- **All orders** remain linked to the customer ID
- **Financial data** is completely preserved
- **Audit trail** maintained with deletion timestamps

### 🗑️ **Soft Delete Process**
- Sets `deleted_at` timestamp when "deleting" a customer
- Customer disappears from main customer list
- All related data remains intact and accessible
- Customer can be restored at any time

### 🔄 **Restore Functionality**
- Deleted customers can be restored with one click
- All data relationships are automatically restored
- No data loss or corruption possible

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Run the Migration**
```bash
python run_customer_soft_delete_migration.py
```

This will:
- Add `deleted_at` column to customers table
- Create performance index
- Add explanatory comments

### 2. **Restart Your Application**
The new functionality will be available immediately after migration.

```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **What Happens When You "Delete" a Customer**
1. Customer record gets `deleted_at` timestamp
2. Customer disappears from main customer list
3. **All orders remain linked** to the customer ID
4. **Financial reports remain accurate**
5. Customer can be restored at any time

### **What Does NOT Happen**
- ❌ Customer data is NOT physically removed
- ❌ Orders are NOT orphaned or lost
- ❌ Financial calculations are NOT affected
- ❌ Customer ID references are NOT broken

### **Performance Considerations**
- Active customer queries automatically filter out deleted customers
- Index on `deleted_at` ensures fast filtering
- No impact on order or financial queries

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Migration Fails**
- Ensure database connection is working
- Check if `deleted_at` column already exists
- Verify SQL file permissions

#### **Customer Not Appearing After Restore**
- Refresh the customer list
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the restore API call succeeded

#### **Performance Issues**
- Ensure the `deleted_at` index was created
- Check database query performance
- Monitor database connection pool

### **Debug Commands**
```sql
-- Check if migration was successful
DESCRIBE customers;

-- View deleted customers directly
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Check index creation
SHOW INDEX FROM customers;
```
