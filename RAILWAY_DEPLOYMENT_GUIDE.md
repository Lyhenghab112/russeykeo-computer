# Railway Deployment Guide

## Your Current Setup is Compatible! ✅

Railway supports your existing MySQL setup with `mysql-connector-python` and `flask-mysqldb`. No code changes needed!

## Step 1: Create Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Create a new project
4. Connect your GitHub repository

## Step 2: Add MySQL Database

1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New" → "Database" → "MySQL"
3. Railway will automatically create a MySQL database
4. Note down the connection details

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, go to your service → Variables tab and add:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
MYSQL_HOST=your-railway-mysql-host
MYSQL_USER=your-railway-mysql-user  
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-railway-mysql-password
MYSQL_DB=your-railway-mysql-database
FLASK_ENV=production
```

## Step 4: Deploy

1. Railway will automatically detect your `Dockerfile`
2. It will build and deploy your app
3. Your app will be available at the provided Railway URL

## Step 5: Database Migration

After deployment, you'll need to run your database migrations:

1. Connect to your Railway MySQL database
2. Import your existing database schema
3. Or run your migration scripts

## Files Created for Railway

- `Dockerfile` - Handles system dependencies for MySQL
- This guide - Step-by-step deployment instructions

## Why This Works

Railway supports your current setup because:
- The Dockerfile installs `default-libmysqlclient-dev` (required for flask-mysqldb)
- Your existing code uses standard MySQL drivers
- No logic changes needed!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
3. Verify database connection details
4. Make sure your database schema is properly migrated
